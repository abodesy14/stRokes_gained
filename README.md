**About the Project** <br>
Welcome to the sg_shiny repo, an intersction of golf and data.
Strokes gained is a way to assess a golfer's strengths and weaknesses compartively to different handicap baselines. Tracking fairways, greens in regulation, and putts does has its benefits, but misses the context surrounding each shot taken. Total putts do not take into account the length of each putt, just as greens in regulation don't factor in the length or difficulty of each approach.
